# A Tank Comparator Web App for WoT: Console

[WoTStars' Tank Compare](https://www.wotstars.com/tank-compare)

A web-app to handle vehicle comparisons for World of Tanks: Console, as an accompaniment to [WoTStars.com](https://www.wotstars.com) stat tracking.

React with TypeScript; Redux; GraphQL (AWS backend); ES2021; Yarn.


## F.A.Q.

### Why?
Created in order to use TypeScript and GraphQL for the first time. Also to brush up on Redux.
Oh, and to provide a little tool for the WoT:C community...

### Is this open source?
Yes.
And should you be mad enough to, you're welcome to use any of the code for anything - **except** making a Tank Comparison type website/web app.

### Is this project affiliated with Wargaming?
The project is in no way affiliated with Wargaming.
